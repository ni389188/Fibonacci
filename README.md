### Comparing Different Approaches to Calculate a Fibonacci Number

This project samples two different approaches to the same problem: Finding a desired Fibonacci number.

The first approach is a recursive one, which is later made more efficient by the use of Memoization. 

The second approach is a Dynamic Programming one.
